        Over the past month, user engagement has increased significantly, with a
        34% rise in daily waste reports, primarily driven by plastic and paper
        submissions. The leaderboard saw intense competition, with top users
        submitting over 150 verified reports. Collection accuracy improved by
        22%, while average response time dropped to under 10 hours. Plastic
        waste remains the most reported type, though biodegradable waste
        collections are growing steadily. Peak reporting occurs at 11 AM and 7
        PM. Reward redemptions rose by 40%, especially among users aged 18-25.
        These insights highlight growing environmental awareness and the
        platform&apos;s impact on sustainable waste practices.
